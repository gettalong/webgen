# This is the YAML configuration file for webgen used to set configuration options.
#
# The general syntax is:
#
#   configuration.option.name: value
#
# For example, to set a different default language, you would do:
#
#   website.lang: de
#
# Have a look at the documentation of the individual configuration options to see
# the allowed format of the values. Since this is a YAML file, you can easily set
# configuration options to strings, integers, dates, arrays, hashes and more.
#
# The available configuration options can be listed using the `webgen config`
# command, for example: `webgen config sourcehandler` will list all options starting
# with sourcehandler.
