  Open source web design template by Andreas Viklund. A very simple design with minimalistic use
  of .classes or IDs in the CSS file. Uses a fixed position site menu, good for small or personal
  sites.
  Have a look at the available styles in the CSS file and visit the homepage to see the original
  template and what can be done with it.
