description:
  Open source web design template by Andreas Viklund. A simple two-column fluid width template
  in orange and grey using animated GIFs. Can be used for normal websites but it is probably best
  used for a blog!
  Have a look at the available styles in the CSS file and visit the homepage to see the original
  template and what can be done with it.
