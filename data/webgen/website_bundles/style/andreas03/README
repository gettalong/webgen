description:
  Open source web design template by Andreas Viklund. An accessible 2-column template in blue, grey
  and white which loads fast and works in all common browsers. Would be a good one for a blog!
  Have a look at the available styles in the CSS file and visit the homepage to see the original
  template and what can be done with it.
