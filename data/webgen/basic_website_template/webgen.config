# This is a webgen configuration file which uses YAML as its syntax.
#
# The general syntax is:
#
#   configuration.option.name: value
#
# Have a look at the documentation of the individual configuration options to see the allowed format
# of the values. Since this is a YAML file, you can easily set configuration options as strings,
# integers, dates, arrays, hashes and more.
#
# The available configuration options can be found on the homepage in the Configuration Option
# Reference at
#
#     http://webgen.gettalong.org/documentation/reference/configuration_options.html

# More info about YAML itself can be found at http://www.yaml.org/
