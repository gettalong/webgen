# Meta Information Reference

Following is a list of all the meta information items that are used in one way or another by an
extension, be it a source handler, a tag or any other extension. Each meta information description
follows the same pattern:

* First the type of the value and an example value are listed.
* Then the paths for which this item is useful are listed.
* And at last follows a detailed description.


{:miref: .meta-information-ref}

### author

* String: `Thomas Leitner`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets the author of the path. This information is used, for example, by Webgen::SourceHandler::Feed.

### author_url

* String: `http://webgen.rubyforge.org`
* Any where `author` is also set
{:miref}

Sets the homepage of the author of the path. This information is used, for example, by
Webgen::SourceHandler::Feed and normally only when `author` is also set.

### blocks

* Hash of Hashes: `\{default: {pipeline:textile}, 1: {name: content, pipeline:maruku,erb,tags}}`
* Files in Webgen Page Format
{:miref}

Specifies the default names and additional options for the blocks. The special key `default` is used
to set default options for all blocks. Specific options for (or the name of) a block can be set by
using the block index as key (numbering starts from one).

### change_freq

* String: `hourly`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets the change frequency of the page. This information is used, for example, by the sitemap source
handler. You can use the following values for this key: `hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly,
never`.

### created_at

* Time: `2008-08-14 10:25:34 +02:00`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets the time when the path was created. This information cannot automatically be derived for paths
provided by Webgen::Source::FileSystem, so this has to be set manually.

> Note that the value needs to be a valid [YAML timestamp](http://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html) and
> needs to include the time part.
{:.information}

### draft

* Boolean: `true`
* Any
{:miref}

If this meta information is set on a path, no node will be created from it. This is useful to add
content to a website which should only be used later on.

### fragments_in_menu

* Boolean: `false`
* Page files
{:miref}

Specifies if the fragment nodes of the page file should be in the menu.

### index_path

* String: `myindex.html`
* Directories
{:miref}

Sets the directory index path for the directory overriding the default value.

### in_menu

* Boolean: `true`
* Any
{:miref}

Specifies if the path should appear in menus.

### kind

* String: `page`
* Any
{:miref}

Specifies the kind of the path. Some source handlers define a default value for this meta
information for nodes created by them.

### lang

* String: `de`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets the language for the path. Has to be a valid ISO-639-1/2 character code for the language. This
meta information needs to be set before a node gets created.

### link

* Hash: `\{next: next_doc.html, prev: prev_doc.html}`
* Page files

Specifies additional information, for example, about the position of the page file regarding other
files. A sample usage would be to express that the page file is logically followed or preceded by
certain page file.

The value needs to be hash and its keys need to be [link types] except for the special `javascript`
and `css` keys (which will be discussed below). The link type is used to specify the relation of the
page to the linked file. The value can either be a string which is interpreted as a path to the
internal or external file; or a hash with arbitrary key-value pairs (use lower case key names) but
it should include at least a `href` key to specify the path to the internal or external file; or an
array containing strings or hashes to specify more than one linked file for a given link type.

The special keys `javascript` and `css` may have an array of strings or a string as value which are
interpreted as path to javascript/CSS files that should be included.

This information is used by [`ContentProcessor::Head`](../contentprocessor/head.html) to insert the
approriate tags in the head section of an HTML document.

[link types]: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links

### link_attrs

* Hash: `\{title: Hallo, class: extra}`
* Any
{:miref}

Specifies additional attribute-value pairs (in form of a Hash) that should be added to a link to the
path.

### meta

* Hash: `\{author: Thomas Leitner, generator: My program}`
* Page files
{:miref}

Specifies names and values for `<meta>` HTML tags. These key-value pairs are then properly escaped
and inserted into the output file by [`ContentProcessor::Head`](../contentprocessor/head.html).

### modified_at

* Time: `2008-08-14 10:25:34 +02:00`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets the time when the path was last modified. This information is automatically set for paths
provided by Webgen::Source::FileSystem (the file modification is used) but can be overridden by
setting it manually. If not set to a valid time, the time when webgen is executed is used for this
meta information.

> Note that the value needs to be a valid [YAML timestamp](http://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html) and
> needs to include the time part.

### no_output

* Boolean: `true`
* Any
{:miref}

Specifies whether an output path for the node should be written or not. This differs from `draft`
that a node for the path gets created nonetheless.

### omit_index_path

* Boolean: `false`
* Index paths
{:miref}

Controls whether the index path should appear in a breadcrumb trail despite the setting of the
`tag.breadcrumbtrail.omit_index_path` option.

### output_path_style

* Array: `[:parent, :basename, [., :lang], .html]`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets a custom output path style for the specified path. The basename is substituted for the value
`:basename` and the language for the value `:lang`. Strings are used verbatim. If `:lang` is
specified in a sub-array, the whole sub-array is omitted, if the configuration option
`sourcehandler.default_lang_in_output_path` is false. For more and detailed information, have look
at the [output path creation section](../manual.html#source-output) of the manual!

> This meta information has to be set BEFORE a node gets created. Setting this value is therefore
> only useful, for example, in the `paths` block of a meta information backing file.
{:.important}

### priority

* Float: `0.5`
* Any
{:miref}

Specifies the priority of this file in respect to all the other files of the website. This
information is used, for example, by the sitemap source handler.

### routed_title

* String: `Image Directory`
* Any
{:miref}

Only used if set on a directory index path; specifies the title of the directory for which it is the
index path. If this meta information is not specified, the title of the directory will be used
instead.

### sort_info

* Integer or String: `15`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets the sort information for the path. Any String or Integer value can be used here. When two nodes
are compared using this information and both have Integers, then an Integer comparision is
done. Otherwise a String comparision is done.

Setting a String value is useful, for example, for specifying dates as sort information.

### template

* String or null: `my.template` or `~`
* Page/Template files
{:miref}

Sets the template for the page/template file overriding the default value. If set to null
(i.e. `~`), no template is used for the page/template file!

### title

* String: `New Title`
* Any
{:miref}

Sets the title for the path.

### used_nodes

* Array: `[*.en.html, test.de.html]`
* Any
{:miref}

The value of this meta information needs to be an array of alcn patterns. All nodes that match at
least one of the patterns are considered to be dependencies of the node. Therefore if any of these
nodes change, the node will be regenerated, too.
