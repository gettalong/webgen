## Tutorial: Creating a Basic Website


### Creating the Basic Directories

webgen needs a special directory structure so that it works out of the box. Basically, you have a
website directory under which the following directories are located:

* `src`: The source directory in which all the source files for the website are.

* `out`: This directory is created, if it does not exist, when webgen generates the HTML files. All
  the output files are put into this directory.

* `ext`: The extension directory (optional). You can put self-written extensions into this directory
  so that they are used by webgen.

The directory in which these directories are in is called the *website directory*.

Don't worry too much about these directories since webgen is able to create the correct directory
structure for you. By running the command `webgen create sample_site`, the website directory
`sample_site` is created with the default website template and website style. You can naturally use
any available template or style by passing their names to the respective options of the `create`
command.

> A *website template* provides a starting point for your website. For example, the `project`
> template defines several pages including a features and about page.
>
> A *website style* defines the look and feel of your website. webgen comes with many predefined
> styles (nearly all of them are converted open source web design styles).

Don't worry if you don't like the used website style - you can easily change it later. Have a look
at [the examples section](0.4.x/examples/website_styles/index.html) (note: these are still the
example from the previous version of webgen but the styles haven't changed) to see demonstrations
for all shipped website templates and styles!

Since the basic parts are now in place, you can generate the HTML files. There are two
possibilities:

* Either you change into the `sample_site` directory and run the command `webgen`.

* Or you run webgen from any directory and specify the website directory using the `-d` option, for
  example `webgen -d sample_site`.

Easy! webgen has used all files in the `src` directory and created the HTML output in the directory
`out`. Since webgen automatically creates relative links, you can just open the `index.html` file
and you will have a fully functional website - no web server needed! However, as we did not write
any content yet, there is not much to see (only the default pages). So let's do that now!


### Adding Content

When using the `create` command, webgen does not only create the needed directories but it also
provides you with some default files, you will normally have at least the following ones:

* `src/default.template`: The default template for the new website.
* `src/default.css`: The default css file for the new website.
* `src/index.page`: The index file for the root directory of the website.
* `config.yaml`: The configuration file for setting configuration options.

> *Template files* and *page files* are the heart of webgen. Template files are used to define a
> general layout for web pages and page files define the real content. Both file types are written
> in [Webgen Page Format]({relocatable: webgen_page_format.html}). Page files are normally written
> in a markup language like Markdown or Textile which is easier to learn and edit for non-technical
> persons.

The basic scaffolding is already in place. Now we only have to adapt the page file `index.page` and
add other page files.

All page files are written using the Webgen Page Format. Basically, you have an optional meta
information block at the beginning of the file and one or more content blocks. Blocks are separated
by three dashes (ie. `---`) on a separate line and if you want to have a meta information block you
need to have a block separator line at the beginning of your file.

Open the file `index.page` in your favorite text editor and change its content (ie. the first
content block). After that create a new file, `hello.page`, in the source directory with the
following content:

    ---
    title: Sample hello page
    in_menu: true
    ---
    This is a sample page with the title "\{title:}" and it is in the menu!!!

We define two meta information items (namely `title` and `in_menu`) and added some content to the
first content block. Run webgen again and open `out/index.html` to view your changes. Add
page files and other content to your website and let it grow!


### Adding Dynamic Content

A static website is, as the name implies, static. However, since we generate the website it is
possible to add some dynamicity to it. For example, it gets very tedious to update menu links every
time we add a file that should be in the menu.

Therefore webgen provides two ways to add dynamic content out of the box:

* *ERB*: This term stands for "embedded ruby". It means that you can embed ruby statements in page
   and templates files that get evaluated when the files are rendered.

* *webgen tags*: These are a way to add dynamic content without knowing a programming language
   (although limiting you to the existing tags). You just state what tag you want to use and it does
   its job. For example, there exists a very flexible menu generation tag.

You have already encountered a webgen tag in the last section when you created the `hello.page`
file: the `\{title:}` part. webgen tags can generally be specified like this: `\{tagname: {param:
value, param2: value2}}`. For detailed information on tags have a look at the
[Webgen::ContentProcessor::Tags]({relocatable: contentprocessor/tags.html}) documentation.


### Setting configuration options

webgen provides a default configuration out of the box. If you can live with that, you do not need
to change any configuration option. However, most users need to change some configuration option
sometime. The configuration file is called `config.yaml` and has to be placed directly under the
website directory. It uses YAML as file format.

> Have a look at the [Configuration Options Reference]({relocatable: reference_configuration.html})
> to get an overview over all available configuration options.
{.information}

Each configuration option can be set in the configuration file by specifing the configuration option
name and the new value as a key/value pair. A sample configuration file looks like this:

    website.lang: de
    website.link_to_current_page: true
