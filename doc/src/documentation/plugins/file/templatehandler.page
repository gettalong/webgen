h2(#description). Description

The template handler processes the templates found in the source directory. Templates, as the name
already implies, normally specify the layout and the overall "picture" of a web page that is defined
using a page file.

These files have the same format as page files - more information about this format can be found
in the <a href="{relocatable: /documentation/references/webpage_format.page}">WebPage Format reference</a>.
The default content format for template files is HTML (contrary to page files).

The parameter {param: File/TemplateHandler:defaultTemplate} specifies the name of the default
template which is used when no explicit template for a page file is set via the meta information
@template@. webgen assumes that the default template is in the same directory as the page file.
However, if it can not be found there, the parent directory is searched for it and so on. If a
default template isn't found in the root directory, no template is used at all. This means that when
you create a default template in the root directory, it is used as template for all page files that
have no explicit template set.

webgen also uses the concept of a template chain to support multiple templates for one page file!
For example, assume that

* the page file @index.page@ has set the @template@ meta information to @special.template@,
* the template @special.template@ has no @template@ meta information set and
* the page file @other.page@ also has no @template@ meta information set.

The template chain for @index.page@ would look like this

@default.template@ <= @special.template@ <= @index.page@

whereas the template chain for @other.page@ would look like this

@default.template@ <= @index.page@

The first case also means that the @special.template@ is nested in the @default.template@! This
makes it possible, for example, to create a general website layout and then to create a special
image gallery layout which uses the general one.

To stop the template handler from further searching for a template, you explicitly need set a null
template for the page or template file:

  template: ~

This is useful if you want to have a different @default.template@ in a sub directory which should
provide a different look-and-feel for this subtree as the @default.template@ in the root of the
website.
