title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Maruku
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in Markdown markup, to HTML by using the
Maruku library. Maruku is a Markdown processor which supports a superset of Markdown, including
support for assigning ids and classes to every element, support for Markdown inside HTML elements
and footnotes.

For detailed information about Maruku have a look at the [Maruku Homepage][1]. There you will find
information about the general Markdown syntax as well as information about the extras added by
Maruku.

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [maruku][1] library. The preferred
> way to do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install maruku

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in Markdown+Extras markup:

    # This a h1 header    {#myid}

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
    [link][1] them below. This is **nice** format!

    > Citations are easy too.
    > Really. And you can assign them attributes.
    {.information}

    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
