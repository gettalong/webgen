title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Sass
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in the Sass meta language, to valid CSS
using the Haml library. For detailed information about Sass have a look at the [Haml Homepage][1]!
The short name of the processor is `sass`!

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [haml][1] library. The preferred way to
> do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install haml
{.exclamation}


## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in the Sass meta language:

    #main
      :width 90%
      p
        :border-style solid
        :border-color #00f
        a
          :font-weight bold
        a:hover
          :text-decoration underline
