title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::RbST
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in reStructuredText markup, to HTML by using the
RbST library. For detailed information about reStructuredText have a look at the [reStructuredText Reference][1]!

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [RbST][2] library. The preferred
> way to do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install RbST
>
> Python 2.3 or greater is also required along with the docutils package[Docutils][3].  The 
> easiest way to install docutils once Python is installed is to do this:
>
>     easy_install docutils

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in reStructuredText markup:


    This is an h1 header 
    ======================

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
    `link <http://someurl.com/>`_ the below. This 
    is also a **nice** format!
    
    Block quotes are just:
    
        Indented paragraphs,
    
            and they may nest.
    
    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
