### webgen Tags

TODO: remove this whole section since it depends on the processing pipeline??? or add a special
section explaining the processing pipeline. ev. move this to the docu for the tags processor. or
still better move this to its own reference section since this is a special webgen construct

Tags are used to generate content. During processing of a file in WebPage Format so called 'tags'
are replaced with dynamic content. For example, the menu you can see to the left was generated by a
tag. This makes it easier to add or remove menu items. If the menu was not generated, you would have
to change every file which uses the menu.

#### Usage

Tags are defined by a special markup code. A tag has the following structure:

    \{tagname: {parameters}}

Every time a tag is found in a file, the registered plugin for the tag is called. The plugin returns
a string which is put into the output file instead of the tag. The output a tag plugin can produce
ranges from something simple to something complex. For example, the Tag/Meta plugin copies any
additional meta information specified in the file verbatim into the correct place in the output
file. And in contrast, the Tag/Menu plugin generates a whole menu tree.

If you want to use the markup code used for tags, you need to escape the tag with a backslash, like
this:

    \\\{tagname: {parameters}}

#### Parameters

A tag can have zero or more parameters some of which are mandatory. You can see the supported
parameters (and if they are mandatory) for each tag on the tag's plugin page. The default mandatory
parameter can be specified in a special way, see the examples below. The format used for parsing the
parameters is YAML.

Here some examples with tags and parameters:

<table class="examples">
<tr>
  <th>Usage</th><th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`\{tagname: }`</td>
  <td>No parameters specified</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`\{tagname: test.html}`</td>
  <td>The default mandatory parameter is set to `test.html`. This form can only be used if there is only one mandatory parameter</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`\{tagname: {param1: value1, param2: value2}}`</td>
  <td>Two parameters (param1 and param2) specified</td>
</tr>
</table>
