title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Less
---
## Description

This content processor converts content in LESS format to valid CSS using the [LESS library][1].

LESS is an extension of CSS which allows the use of variables, mixins, operations and nested rules.
Since a normal CSS file is a valid LESS file, the transition to LESS is very easy. For detailed
information about LESS have a look at its [documentation page][2]!

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [less][1] library. The preferred way to
> do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install less

## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in LESS format:

    @base: #543;

    #header {
      color: @base;
      a {
        color: @base * 2;
        text-decoration: underline;
      }
    }
