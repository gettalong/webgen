#### Evaluating ERB Tags

TODO: ev move this to the ContentProcessor/Erb documentation???

The evaluation of ERB (embedded ruby) tags is optional and only done if the meta information
`useERB` is set to `true`. The use of ERB allows to add dynamic content without using webgen tags.
Following is an example of a file which uses ERB:

<notextile>
<pre>
\---
title: Test page with ERB
useERB: true
\---
This page has the following meta info items:
&lt;% node.meta_info.each do |key, value| %&gt;
    * &lt;%=key %&gt;: &lt;%=value %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
</notextile>

This would output all meta information for the file. There are some objects available which you can
use in your ERB code:

* `node`: the node for the current file (normally a page file)
* `ref_node`: the reference node, i.e. the node in which the content will be embedded (normally a
  template file)

*Caveat*: you may need to ensure that the ERB start and end tags are not processed by the content
converter. For example, with Textile you may need to surround the ERB code with &lt;textile&gt;
tags!
