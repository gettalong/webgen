title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::RDiscount
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in Markdown markup, to HTML by using the
RDiscount library. This library is based on the C based discount library which provides very fast
Markdown processing. However, this processor does not support advanced features like the [kramdown
processor](kramdown.html) or [Maruku Markdown processor](maruku.html) do.

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [rdiscount][1] library. The preferred
> way to do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install rdiscount

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in Markdown markup:

    # This a h1 header

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
    [link][1] them below. This is **nice** format!

    > Citations are easy too.
    > Really. And you can assign them attributes.

    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
