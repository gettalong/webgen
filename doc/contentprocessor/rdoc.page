## Description

This content processors converts content written in RDoc markup (the default documentation format
for Ruby source files, [reference][1]) to HTML.

> implementation included in the Ruby distribution. The preferred way to install the new
> implementation is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install rdoc

## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in RDoc markup:

    = This a h1 header

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and <a href="http://someurl.com">link</a> them below.
    This is also a _nice_ format!

    <blockquote class='information>
    Citations are easy too.
    Really. And you can assign them attributes.
    </blockquote>

    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
