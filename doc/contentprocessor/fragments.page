title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Fragments
---
## Description

This processor generates nested fragment nodes from all headers `h1` to `h6` which have an `id`
attribute set.

> This is only done for the block named `content` or if no block is associated with the given render
> context! This is to ensure that fragment nodes are not created from multiple block of one page
> file. So this content processor has no effect when used in the pipeline of blocks except if the
> block is named `content`.
{:.warning}

The default markup language kramdown automatically generates an `id` attribute for all headers. If
you use another markup language or plain old HTML, you might need to set the `id` attributes by
hand.

> The reason why only header tags with an `id` attribute are used is that only those can be
> referenced and linked to later.
{:.information}

The generated fragment nodes can be used like any other node. So you can link to them and use them
in a menu. Concerning the menu, there is a setting for the `tag.menu.used_nodes` option called
`fragments` which only uses the fragment node of the current page to generate a menu. This allows to
generate a nice overview of the page.
