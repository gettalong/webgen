title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::RedCloth
summary: Converts content written in Textile markup to HTML
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in Textile markup, to HTML by using the
RedCloth library. For detailed information about Textile have a look at the [Textile Reference][1]!

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [redcloth][2] library. The preferred
> way to do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install RedCloth
{:.warning}

You can use the configuration option `contentprocessor.redcloth.hard_breaks` to enable/disable the
conversion of single newlines into HTML break tags.

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in Textile markup:

    h1(#myid). This a h1 header

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
    "link":http://someurl.com them below. This is also a
    **nice** format!

    <blockquote class='information>
    Citations are easy too.
    Really. And you can assign them attributes.
    </blockquote>

    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
