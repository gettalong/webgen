title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Haml
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in the Haml markup language, to valid
XHTML by using the Haml library. For detailed information about Haml have a look at the [Haml
Homepage][1]! The short name of the processor is `haml`!

You can use some special objects provided by webgen in your Haml markup. These are the same objects
that are available to the `erb` processor, have a look at its [documentation page]({relocatable:
erb.html}).

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [haml][1] library. The preferred way to
> do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install haml
{.exclamation}


## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in Haml markup:

    %h1#myid This a h1 header

    %p
      You can just write
      %b your
      paragraphs here and
      %a{:href => 'http://someurl.com'} link
      them below. This is a
      %strong nice
      format!

    %blockquote.information
      Citations are easy too.
      Really. And you can assign them attributes.

    %ul
      %li Lists
      %li aren't
      %li difficult
      %li either.
