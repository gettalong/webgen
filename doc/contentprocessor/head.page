title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Head
---
## Description

This processor inserts before the end of the HTML head section links to used javascript and css
files, inline javascript and css content and general meta tags. This functionality can be used, for
example, by webgen tags to add needed javascript or css fragments on a page-per-page basis.

It can also be used to insert arbitrary meta tags on a page-per-page basis. This can be done by
setting the meta information named [`meta`]({relocatable: ../reference_metainfo.html#meta}) on a
page file.

This content processor should be used on template files since its output is only useful in the head
section of an HTML file. And it should be the last content processor in the pipeline because
otherwise not all needed information is available! There is no need for a special markup since the
HTML head end tag is unique in a HTML element and therefore the insertion place can easily be found.

Developers wanting to use the functionality of this content processor should have a look at its [API
documentation](../rdoc/Webgen/ContentProcessor/Head.html).
