title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Head
---
## Description

This processor is used to insert various HTML tags (`link`, `script` and `meta`) before the end of
the HTML head section. The tags that tags are inserted can be specified in various ways:

* Links to used javascript and css files, inline javascript and css content and general meta tags
  can be set by webgen tags (or by any other webgen extension) on a page-per-page basis.

* Arbitrary meta tags can be inserted on a page-per-page basis by the user by setting the meta
  information named [`meta`](../reference_metainfo.html#meta) on a page file.

* Links to javascript and/or CSS files can be inserted by the user by setting the meta information
  named [`link`](../reference_metainfo.html#link).

* Arbitrary link tags can also be inserted by setting the meta information named
  [`link`](../reference_metainfo.html#link). This allows one, for example, to specify which page
  file logically follows or precedes a given page file.

The processor also automatically inserts `link` tags to translations of the rendered page file.

This content processor should be used on template files since its output is only useful in the head
section of an HTML file. And it should be the last content processor in the pipeline because
otherwise not all needed information is available! There is no need for a special markup since the
HTML head end tag is unique in a HTML element and therefore the insertion place can easily be found.

Developers wanting to use the functionality of this content processor should have a look at its [API
documentation](../rdoc/Webgen/ContentProcessor/Head.html).
