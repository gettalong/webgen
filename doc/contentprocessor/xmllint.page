title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Xmllint
---
## Description

This content processor uses the `xmllint` program from the ["libxml2" package][1] to check the input
for well-formedness and/or validness. `xmllint` can validate an XML (and therefore an XHTML) file
against a DTD, a RelaxNG schema or a WXS schema. For more information about where to put the DTD or
schema files, have a look at the `libxml2` documentation.

The configuration option `contentprocessor.xmllint.options` can be used to change the default
command line options that are used for the `xmllint` program.
