Sass. For detailed information about Sass and Sassy CSS have a look at the [Haml Homepage][1]!

## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in the Sassy CSS language:

    #main {
      width: 90%;

      p {
        border-style: solid;
        border-color: #00f;

        a {
          font-weight: bold;
        }
        a:hover {
          :ext-decoration: underline;
        }
      }
    }
