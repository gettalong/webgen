title: Webgen::ContentProcessor::Kramdown
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in kramdown format, to HTML by using the
[kramdown][1] library. The kramdown format is basically Markdown with some extensions like automatic
header ID generation, using markup inside HTML elements and so on. There are a [quick reference][2]
and a detailed [syntax documentation][3] available on the kramdown homepage.

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in kramdown markup:

    # This a h1 header
    {:#myid}

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
    [link][1] them below. This is **nice** format!

    > Citations are easy too.
    > Really. And you can assign them attributes.

    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
