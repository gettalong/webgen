# Upgrading

Here are step-by-step instructions on how to update your webgen website from 0.4.x to 0.5.x:

* **Update the configuration file `config.yaml`**

  The configuration file syntax as well as the names of the configuration options and some defaults
  changed. For example, the default processing pipeline now uses kramdown (a Markdown converter) as
  markup language processor instead of Textile. You can find an overview over all available
  configuration options in the [configuration option reference](references/configuration.html). Also
  have a look at the [configuration file documentation](manual.html#website-configfile) for more
  information on the syntax of this file and the available helpers.

  * Name changes: All configuration options now use underscores to separate word parts instead of
    camelCase.
  * Syntax changes: The configuration options are not specific to a certain extension anymore. You
    now need the full configuration option name to specify it. So instead of

        Tag/Menu:
          maxLevels: 4

    you now use

        tag.menu.max_levels: 4

* **Convert your `metainfo.yaml`**

  This file is not supported anymore since webgen 0.5.x uses a more flexible way for specifying meta
  information and virtual paths. You need to migrate its data to `metainfo` and `virtual` files in
  the source directory. Have a look at the documentation of the [metainfo source
  handler](sourcehandler/metainfo.html) and the [virtual source
  handler](sourcehandler/virtual.html).

* **Update meta information names and values**

  The names of some meta information keys have been changed. Meta information names are not
  specified in camelCase anymore but with under_scores. You can find a complete list of supported
  meta information names in the [meta information reference](references/metainfo.html). The most
  notable changes are:

  * directoryName → routed_title
  * inMenu → in_menu
  * indexFile → index_path
  * omitIndexPath → omit_index_path
  * outputNameStyle → output_path_style
  * orderInfo → sort_info

  Also be aware that the syntax of some meta information keys has changed. For example, all meta
  information keys that took a source path name, e.g. `index_path`, now take an localized canonical
  name.

  You need to change the names/value in all places where meta information can be specified:

  * `metainfo` files
  * `virtual` files
  * page and template files

* **Files in [Webgen Page Format](references/webgen_page_format.html)**

  Since the format of these files changed a little bit you may need to adapt all your files that use
  it, that are primarily page and template files. The main change in the format was a different use
  of the block start line. Whereas before you would write

      --- content, textile

  for specifying the name of the block and its processor, you now can specify any number of
  options. Two options are currently used by webgen: `name` and `pipeline`. So you could change the
  name and the processing pipeline of a block by using a block start line like:

      --- name:other pipeline:tags,kramdown,blocks

* **Block inclusion in template/page files**

  The way how named blocks are included has changed. This feature is now provided by the content
  processor [blocks](contentprocessor/blocks.html) instead of the tag `block`. This allows you to
  specify the point in the processing pipeline when a block should be included. So you definitely
  need to update your `default.template` file as well as any other page/template file where you used
  the `block` tag.

  So you need to look for `\{block: content}` tags (where `content` is just a place holder for the
  name of the block that should be included) and replace them with `<webgen:block name='content'
  />`.

* **Update tag names and parameters**

  Since the names of the configuration options changed (from using camelCase to using under_scores)
  and some tags have different options, you need to change all tag parameters. You may also need to
  convert old tag names to new ones (same reason: camelCase to under_score), for example,
  `includeFile` is now `include_file`.

* **Update your ERB code**

  If you have any ERB code in your template or page files you will most certainly have to adapt them
  to the new [API](api.html). One thing that has been used often is the check if a page file has a
  certain block:

      <%% if node.node_info[:page_data].blocks.has_key?('NAME') %>
      ...
      <%% end %>

  This needs to be changed into the following:

      <%% if context.content_node.node_info[:page].blocks.has_key?('NAME') %>
      ...
      <%% end %>

* **Extensions development**

  Since the complete core of webgen has changed you need to rewrite all your plugins for the 0.5.x
  series. Howver, webgen has complete [API documentation](api.html) now which provides you with all
  needed information as well as examples on how to implement source handlers, tags, content
  processors, ... If you still have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me or write a mail to
  the mailing list!

* **Running webgen on the converted website**

  You now can run webgen 0.5.x on the converted website. This helps in ironing out the remaining
  errors, for example:

  * If you have forgotten to change a block start line, you will get an application error and the
    name of the file where the error occured.

  * If you have overlooked changing a tag parameter, you will find `ERROR` and `WARN` lines in the
    log output showing you what still needs to be changed.

* **Not Implement Yet**: There are several features of the 0.4.x series which are currently not
  implemented in the 0.5.x series:

  * source handlers: gallery, sipttra
  * tags: customvar (won't be ported), download, htmlmetainfo, news (won't be ported, superceded
    by blogging support), resource, wikilink
  * misc: smiley replacer, html validators
  * CLI commands: check, show, use

  If you need any of those you have to wait till they are implemented or port them on your on.
