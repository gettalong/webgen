# Upgrading

Here are some helpers to make upgrading a webgen website from 0.4.x to 0.5.x more easy:

* **Files in [Webgen Page Format]({relocatable: webgen_page_format.html})**: Since the format of
  these files changed a little bit you may need to adapt all your files that use it, that is
  primarily page and template files. The main change in the format was a different use of the block
  separator line. Whereas before you would write

      --- content, textile

  for specifying the name of the block and its processor, you now can specify any number of
  options. Two options are currently used by webgen: `name` and `pipeline`. So you could change the
  name and the processing pipeline of a block by using a block start line like:

      --- name:other pipeline:tags,maruku,blocks

* **Block inclusion in template/page files**: The way how named blocks are included has
  changed. This feature is now provided by the content processor [blocks]({relocatable:
  contentprocessor/blocks.html}) instead of the tag `block`. This allows you to specify the point in
  the processing pipeline when a block should be included. So you definitely need to update your
  `default.template` file as well as any other page/template file where you used the `block` tag.

  So you need to look for `\{block: content}` tags (where `content` is just a place holder for the
  name of the block that should be included) and replace them with `<webgen:block name='content'
  />`.

* **Meta information names**: The names of some meta information keys have been changed. Meta
  information names are not specified in camelCase anymore but with under\_scores. You can find a
  complete list of supported meta information names in the [meta information
  reference]({relocatable: reference_metainfo.html}). The most notable changes are:

  * directoryName → routed\_title
  * inMenu → in\_menu
  * indexFile → index\_path
  * omitIndexPath → omit\_index\_path
  * outputNameStyle → output\_path\_style
  * orderInfo → sort\_info

* **website\_dir/metainfo.yaml**: This file is not supported anymore since webgen 0.5.x uses a more
  flexible way for specifying meta information and virtual paths. You need to migrate its data to
  `metainfo` and `virtual` files in the source directory. Have a look at the documentation of the
  [metainfo source handler]({relocatable: sourcehandler/metainfo.html}) and the [virtual source
  handler]({relocatable: sourcehandler/virtual.html}).

* **Configuration file syntax**: The configuration file syntax as well as the names of the
  configuration options and some defaults changed. For example, the default processing pipeline now
  uses Maruku (a Markdown converter) as markup language processor. You can find an overview over all
  available configuration options in the [configuration option reference]({relocatable:
  reference_configuration.html}). Also have a look at the [configuration file
  documentation]({relocatable: manual.html#website-configfile}) for more information on the syntax
  of this file and the available helpers.

* **Extensions development**: Since the complete core of webgen has changed you need to rewrite all
  your plugins for the 0.5.x series. Howver, webgen has complete [API documentation]({relocatable:
  api.html}) now which provides you with all needed information as well as examples on how to
  implement source handlers, tags, content processors, ... If you still have any questions, don't
  hesitate to contact me or write a mail to the mailing list!

* **Not Implement Yet**: There are several features of the 0.4.x series which are currently not
  implemented in the 0.5.x series:

  * source handlers: gallery, sipttra
  * tags: customvar (won't be ported), download, htmlmetainfo, news (won't be ported, superceded
    by blogging support), wikilink
  * misc: smiley replacer, html validators

  If you need any of those you have to wait till they are implemented or port them on your on.
