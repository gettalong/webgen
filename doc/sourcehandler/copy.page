title: Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy
---
## Description

This source handler copies files from the source to the output directory, optionally running a
content processor over the content. It is useful, for example, for CSS stylesheets, javascript files
and images.

It decides using the file extension if a content processor should be used and which one. If the
short name of a content processor is the first part of the file extension, the file is processed by
this content processor and the first part is removed from the file extension. Otherwise no
processing is done at all. For example, a file named `hello.jpg` just gets copied verbatimly but a
file named `usage.erb.html` gets preprocessed by the `erb` content processor and written to a file
named `usage.html`. As you can see in this example, the processor name gets stripped from the file
extension.

If you want to use a specific content processor for processing a file, have a look at its
documentation page which shows the unique short name that needs to be used in the file extension.
