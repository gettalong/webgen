title: Webgen::SourceHandler::Sitemap
summary: Generates a sitemap file
---
## Description

This source handler automatically generates a sitemap based on the specification of
[sitemaps.org](http://sitemaps.org) from a file in [Webgen Page
Format](../references/webgen_page_format.html). The output and canonical names have the extension
`xml` instead of `sitemap`.

The following meta information keys are supported:

*   `site_url` (MANDATORY)

    The base url of the website for which the sitemap is generated.

*   `default_change_freq` (OPTIONAL)

    The default change frequency of a file.

*   `default_priority` (OPTIONAL)

    The default priority of a file.

You can also specify all common sitemap configuration options to customize the output of the source
handler.

The following meta information keys of files are used if they are specified:

*   `modified_at`

    The time at which the file was last modified, used as the time at which this feed entry was
    updated.

*   `change_freq`

    The change frequency of the the file.

*   `priority`

    The priority of the file in respect to the other files.

The generation of the sitemap is done via a template and the template used needs to be located under
the ALCN `/templates/sitemap.template`. This default template is automatically created and used if
no such path exists in the webgen website. You can also override the default generation mechanism on
a file per file basis by adding a `template` block in the sitemap file which is then used to generate
the sitemap.
