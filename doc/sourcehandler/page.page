title: Webgen::SourceHandler::Page
---
## Description

This source handler uses page files which are used to specify the actual content for the
website. These files are written using [Webgen Page Format]({relocatable:
../webgen_page_format.html}). Therefore they contain the content for the web page and, optionally,
meta information.

*In contrast* to other handled files, page files can never be unlocalized! If they have no language
set, the default language specified using the configuration option `website.lang` is used. This
means that for the default language set to English and a source path named `index.page`, the
language meta information is automatically set to English.

## Fragment nodes

The page handler automatically generates fragment nodes for all found header tags in the block named
`content` (i.e. `h1`, `h2`, ...) that have an `id` attribute set. The default markup language Maruku
automatically generates an `id` attribute for all headers. If you use another markup language or
plain old HTML, you might need to set the `id` attributes by hand.

> The reason why only header tags with an `id` attribute are used is that only those can be
> referenced and linked to later.
{.information}

The generated fragment nodes can be used like any other node. So you can link to them and use them
in a menu. Concerning the menu, there is a setting for the `tag.menu.used_nodes` option called
`fragments` which only uses the fragment node of the current page to generate a menu. This allows to
generate a nice overview of the page.
