title: Webgen::SourceHandler::Page
---
## Description

This source handler uses page files which are used to specify the actual content for the website.
These files are written using [Webgen Page Format](../references/webgen_page_format.html). Therefore
they contain the content for the web page and, optionally, meta information. The extension `page` is
changed to `html` for the output file and canonical names.

*In contrast* to other handled files, page files can never be unlocalized! If they have no language
set, the default language specified using the configuration option `website.lang` is used. This
means that for the default language set to English and a source path named `index.page`, the
language meta information is automatically set to English.
