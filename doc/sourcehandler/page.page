### Processing

TODO: redo this whole section

There is a well defined procesing order for files in WebPage Format:

* After reading in the file, it is split into the blocks.

* Each content block is converted to HTML (depends on the format specifier) and the HTML sections
  are resolved (caveat: only those with an `id` attribute)

* When writing out the file, the converted content is first processed with ERB (if specified to do
  so),

* then webgen tags are replaced and,

* finally, the result is written.

The first two steps happen when the file is read and the last three when the file is written.

#### Converting to HTML

The conversion of a content block to HTML is done via the ContentConverter plugins. Each plugin is
able to convert a special marked-up text to HTML.
