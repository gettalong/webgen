title: Webgen::SourceHandler::Directory
---
## Description

The directory handler is used for handling directories, ie. it creates the target directories.
Additionally an index path for each directory can be specified which is used instead of the plain
directory index for displaying purposes. This means that when the directory path is specified
(e.g. by Webgen::Tag::Relocatable) the index path is returned.

The name of the index path is specified with the meta information `index_path` which is set to
`index.html` by default. This meta information needs to be set directly on the directory node (for
example, via a meta information backing file).

The title for a directory can be set via the `title` meta information on the directory itself.
However, if the directory has an index path, the meta information `routed_title` of the index path
is used for the directory title. This enables webgen to provide correctly localized directory names.

Normally, webgen shows a warning if it could not find the directory index path for a directory.
However, there are most certainly directories which should not have an index path, for example, a
directory containing only images. To prevent webgen from displaying warnings for such directories,
you can set a null index path using a meta information backing file:

    dirWithOnlyImages:
      index_path: ~

This will prevent webgen from showing warnings because you explicitly define a null index path.
