title: Webgen::SourceHandler::Feed
---
## Description

This source handler automatically generates an atom or RSS feed for a set of files from a file in
[Webgen Page Format]({relocatable: ../webgen_page_format.html}) (the format which is also used for
page files).

The following meta information keys are supported:

*   `entries` (MANDATORY)

    A LCN pattern (or an array of LCN patterns) which specify the page files that should be
    used. Other matched files are excluded from the list.

*   `number_of_entries` (OPTIONAL)

    The number of entries that should be included in the feed. Defaults to 10.

*   `atom` (OPTIONAL)

    An atom feed is generated if this key is set to `true`. Defaults to `true`.

*   `rss` (OPTIONAL)

    A RSS feed is generated if this key is set to `true`. Defaults to `true`.

*   `site_url` (MANDATORY)

    The base url of the website for which the feed is generated.

*   `author` (MANDATORY)

    Specifies the author of the feed.

*   `author_url` (OPTIONAL)

    Specifies the URL of the homepage of the author.

*   `title` (MANDATORY)

    The title of the feed.

*   `description` (OPTIONAL)

    A short description of the feed.

*   `created_at` (OPTIONAL)

    The time at which this feed was created. Defaults to the current time if not set.

*   `icon` (OPTIONAL)

    The absolute localized canonical name of the feed's icon image.

The following meta information keys of page files are used if they are specified:

*   `created_at`

    The time at which the page file was created, used as the publication time.

*   `modified_at`

    The time at which the page file was last modified, used as the time at which this feed entry was
    updated.

*   `title`

    The title of the page file, used as title of the feed entry.

*   `author`

    The name of the author of the page file, used as the author of the feed entry.

*   `author_url`

    The URL of the homepage of the author. Only used if the `author` meta information is also set.

The default implementation supports the generation of atom and RSS feeds. You can override the
default generation mechanism by adding an `atom_template` and/or `rss_template` block in the feed
file which are then used to generate the atom or the RSS feed respectively.
