title: Webgen::Tag::Relocatable
---
## Description

This tag ensures that the relative path to the specified path is always correct. It has one
mandatory parameter, namely the configuration option `tag.relocatable.path`.

When the tag is used, it changes the directory part of the supplied path name to a relative path to
the destination and is most often used in template files. A relocatable tag looks like this:
`\{relocatable: default.css}`. If this was put into a template and the template was used by a file
in a subdirectory, then the `relocatable` tag would put `../default.css` into the output file; thus
ensuring that the relative path to file is valid.

> You can only use the `relocatable` tag with paths that are handled by webgen. If you want to
> handle paths that are not normally handled by webgen, create a virtual path for them.
{.exclamation}

If the specified path is an absolute URL (like `http://webgen.rubyforge.org`), it will just return
it. And if you specify an URL fragment, this fragment has to exist. If you don't want to resolve a
fragment, just don't specify it in the tag but afterwards!
