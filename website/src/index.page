## Welcome to the homepage of _webgen_!

webgen is a *free* (GPL-licensed) command line application for generating static websites. You could
write a static website by hand, of course. But by using webgen you have several advantages:

* **The page layout is separated from the content**: if you change the layout, all pages that use
  that layout are automatically updated. You can have any number of different layouts and even
  nested ones.

* **Write content in a markup language**: The content and layout files can be written in a markup
    language like Markdown, Textile or Haml which lets you concentrate more on what you write.

* **Automation**: webgen can automatically generate, for example, menus and breadcrumb trails for
    you.

* **Dynamic content**: It is easy to add some dynamic content if there is a need for it.

* **Self-Contained websites**: webgen websites are self contained since all generated links are
    relative ones. This allows one to preview a generated site without a web server!

The above list should just give you a glimpse of what is possible with webgen. Have a look at the
[features page](features.html) for a more complete list and a feature comparison to
other static website generators.

Although webgen is very powerful it is also very easy to use. A basic website can be created in just
one step by executing

    webgen create mywebsite

This command will create the directory `mywebsite` which houses the newly created webgen website and
some content files to start with. By running the command `webgen` inside the `mywebsite` directory,
the website will be generated and put into the `out` directory where it can be viewed with any
browser:

    cd mywebsite
    webgen                # -> creates an out/ directory with the HTML output

Actually, this website was generated with webgen and provides an online demonstration of its
features. For example, the menu that you can see at the top was created dynamically. For more
information have a look at the [documentation](/documentation/)!
