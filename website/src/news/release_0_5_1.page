### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

--- name:notes pipeline:kramdown

Since the 0.5.0 release did not have as many features as the older 0.4.x releases, this release as
well as the next few releases concentrate on porting features from the latest 0.4.x version. The
focus of this release was adding the missing content processors and most of the more widely used
tags.

If you want to have a currently missing feature in the next release, write to the mailing list!

A new [google group][google-group] which mirrors the `webgen-users` mailing list on Rubyforge has
also be created.
