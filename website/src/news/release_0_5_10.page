### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

--- name:notes pipeline:tags,kramdown

This is just a small bug fix release. The only change feature wise was the addition of a content
processor for checking XML (XHTML) files for validness.

--- name:changes pipeline:tags,kramdown

* Minor enhancements:

  - Added content processor [`xmllint`][1] for checking an XML (XHTML) file for well-formedness and
    validness

* Bug fixes:

  - `Tag::TikZ`: the generated image tags now always have an `alt` attribute
  - Fixed problem with the webgui when creating a new website
  - Fixed problem with matching directory nodes (reported by Hermann Schichl)
  - Fixed bug RF#26885: paths with dots in the extension and without a language part were handled
    incorrectly (reported by John Lockman)
  - Fixed bug RF#26890: detecting unused paths did not always work correctly (reported by John
    Lockman)
  - Fixed problem with handling paths of the form `NUMBER.REST` (e.g. `1340.png`): the number part
    is now considered the basename and the rest is the extension
