  - Fixed problem with the webgui when creating a new website

  - Fixed bug RF#26885: paths with dots in the extension and without a language part were handled
    incorrectly (reported by John Lockman)
  - Fixed bug RF#26890: detecting unused paths did not always work correctly (reported by John
    Lockman)
  - Fixed problem with handling paths of the form `NUMBER.REST` (e.g. `1340.png`): the number part
    is now considered the basename and the rest is the extension
