### Changes

This release brings some updates to the core as well as a browser based GUI, some bug fixes and
better Windows support. The most noteable update to the core is better partial site generation
support.

When a file that was in the menu changed, all files which included a menu with a link to this file
got regenerated, too. However, that was not always necessary since the content of the changed file
does not appear in the menu, only its meta information `title`. Therefore the new system checks if
the meta information of the changed file has changed and only then regenerates all menus. This
system is now also used by all other extensions like the breadcrumb trail or the langbar tag.

The new webgen webgui which can be started via `webgen webgui` is a graphical pendant to the command
line interface. It features

* auto-completion of entered website directory paths
* possibility to create and render websites
* live view of a rendered website or preview of a to-be-created website

The preview mode when creating a website is very useful for choosing the right template and style
for a new website, especially for people new to webgen.
