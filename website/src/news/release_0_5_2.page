### Changes

This release brings some updates to the core as well as some bug fixes and better Windows
support. The most noteable update to the core is better partial site generation support.

When a file that was in the menu changed, all files which included a menu with a link to this file
got regenerated, too. However, that was not always necessary since the content of the changed file
does not appear in the menu, only its meta information `title`. Therefore the new system checks if
the meta information of the changed file has changed and only then regenerates all menus. This
system is now also used by all other extensions like the breadcrumb trail or the langbar tag.
