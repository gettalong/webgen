### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

--- name:notes pipeline:tags,kramdown

In this release there are two big changes regarding the internals of webgen:

1. The dependency on facets has been removed since it was only used in two or three places and since
   the facets project is not very stable regarding its API.

2. The default markup language used by the webgen is Markdown and the default processor for
   converting Markdown to HTML has been Maruku for a long time. However, Maruku has some bugs that
   need to be fixed and although it runs under Ruby 1.9 there are some issues. Therefore the new
   default processor for Markdown will be [kramdown][2] from now on. Aside from being actively
   maintained, it is about 5x faster than Maruku and runs on Ruby 1.9 without problems.

   This means that if you used the default configuration, you will automatically use kramdown from
   now on. If you still want to use Maruku, just change the default processing pipeline for page
   files:

       default_processing_pipeline:
         Page: erb,tags,maruku,blocks,fragments

   The short name `markdown` now also refers to kramdown instead of Maruku.

Aside from the new content processor [kramdown][2], another content processor for [LESS][3] has been
added and the content processor [head][4] has been updated to handle arbitrary `link` tags. Many
bugs have been fixed in this release as well.

*Note*: All deprecated methods have been removed in this release!
