### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

--- name:notes pipeline:tags,kramdown

This release brings some very useful new features and paves the way for more new features in the
next versions!

The most notable change is that there is no distinction between website styles and templates anymore
- both are called bundles now or more specifically, for example, style bundles. Since both were
basically the same but provided different kinds of content I thought that it would be useful to drop
the distinction.

This also lead to changes in the CLI command `create` which can now take any number of website
bundles from which the new website will be created. Also, the `create` command got a new companion,
the `apply` command which can be used to apply website bundles to an already existing website.

But that's not all regarding website bundles: after the addition of a new source class for handling
local or remote, possibily gzipped, tar archives, it is now very easy to provide style bundles or
even complete websites on websites. For example, if a user develops a new website style bundle and
puts it on his website, anyone can use it by just using

    webgen create -b default -b http://www.example.com/webgen/ubercool-style.tar.gz new_site

As usual, some minor enhancements, many bug fixes and many documentation updates made it into this
release! See the changes section for a complete list of changes and also note that some parts of the
API got deprecated!

--- name:changes pipeline:tags,kramdown

* Major enhancements:

  - Everything except feed handling (due to the dependency `feedtools` not working) is now Ruby 1.9
    compatible! However, be aware that some used libraries may not work correctly under Ruby 1.9 -
    this is, for example, sometimes the case with Maruku!
  - The distinction between website styles and website templates is no more - say welcome to website
    bundles!
  - Added new source class which can handle local or remote (gzipped) tar archives - see
    [Source::TarArchive][3]
  - Added new CLI command for applying a style bundle to a webgen website - see [The `webgen`
    command][2]


* Minor enhancements:

  - Added new value `current` for attribute `node` for webgen block content processor - see
    [ContentProcessor::Blocks][1]
  - The CLI commands `apply` and `create` can now make use of remote website bundles due to
    [Source::TarArchive][3]
  - Added new option [`contentprocessor.redcloth.hard_breaks`][6] for specifying if single newlines
    should become HTML line break tags
  - The use of the environment variable `WEBGEN_WEBSITE` moved from the CLI to the main
    Webgen::Website class sothat it is also available when programmatically using webgen.


* Bug fixes:

  - `Tag::Link`: the linked-to node is now correctly specified for partial site regeneration
  - Fixed `Node#changed?` and `Node#meta\_info\_changed?`: dependent meta information nodes are now
    checked in `Node#changed?`
  - `SourceHandler::Virtual`: changes in the meta information for virtual nodes are now correctly
    detected
  - `SourceHandler::Metainfo`: empty meta information files don't throw errors anymore
  - `SourceHandler::Metainfo`: deleting a path/alcn from a meta information file now correctly
    updates the affected nodes
  - `SourceHandler::Virtual`/`SourceHandler::Page`: detection of deleted paths between webgen runs
    now works correctly and doesn't throw error anymore (bug reported by Tim Hunter)
  - `SourceHandler::Fragment`: fixed bug with header tag attribute parsing
  - Fixed a small CSS bug in the website bundle style-andres06
  - Fixed bug in CLI: commands specified in `ext/init.rb` are now correctly recognized
  - `Webgen::Website`: `#execute_in_env` now correctly sets back prior website object
  - Updated used versions of dependencies, rake is now a development dependency, all development
    dependencies now use `>=` instead of just `=`. This fixes a bug with rake (reported by Chad
    Wooley)


* Documentation:

  - The documentation now includes [previews][5] of all website style bundles
  - The [configuration option reference][7] now shows the default values for each option
  - Updated installation instructions and added platform specific notes
  - Added documentation for [Source::FileSystem][4] and [Source::TarArchive][3]
  - Other general user documentation updates
  - Went through the whole API documentation and fixed documentation bugs and added some new
    documentation
  - Online API documentation now uses the new RDoc template *darkfish*


* Deprecation notes:

  - The objects `node`, `ref_node`, `dest_node` and `website` are deprecated and will be removed in
    one of the next versions, use `context.node`, `context.ref_node`, `context.dest_node` and
    `context.website` instead!
  - `Node#flagged` is now called `Node#flagged?` - the old name will be removed in one of the next
    releases.
  - `Webgen::Block` is now named `Webgen::Page::Block` and `Webgen::WebgenPageFormatError` is now
    called `Webgen::Page::FormatError` - the old names will be removed in one of the next releases.
  - `Webgen::ContentProcessor::Context` is now named `Webgen::Context` - the old name will be removed in
    one of the next releases.
  - All website templates have been removed, there is just one `default` website bundle instead for
    a default website.
  - The class `Webgen::WebsiteManager` now handles bundles instead of styles and templates.
