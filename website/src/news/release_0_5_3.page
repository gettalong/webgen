### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

This release brings some usability and feature enhancements to webgen.

* Setting some configuration options (for example, the path patterns used by
  Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy) was very complicated in previous releases. With the introduction of
  configuration file helpers this gets much easier now. For example, adding some path patterns for
  Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy can be done like this now:

      patterns:
        Copy:
          add: [**/*.pdf, **/*.avi]

* A new source handler for automatic feed generation has been added. This is the first part of the
  blogging support that will be introduced in the following versions of webgen.
