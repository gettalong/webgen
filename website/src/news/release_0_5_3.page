This release brings some usability and feature enhancements to webgen as well as several bug
fixes. Also note that this release require facets version 2.4.3 instead of 2.4.1!

* Setting some configuration options (for example, the path patterns used by
  Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy) was very complicated in previous releases. With the introduction of
  configuration file helpers this gets much easier now. For example, adding some path patterns for
  Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy can be done like this now:

      patterns:
        Copy:
          add: [**/*.pdf, **/*.avi]

* A new source handler for automatic feed generation has been added. This is the first part of the
  blogging support that will be introduced in the following versions of webgen.

* Major enhancements:

  - Added a [feed source handler] for generating atom and/or RSS feeds.

* Minor enhancements:

  - Added configuration file helpers, see [configuration file] documentation.
  - Updated [metainfo source handler] to be more efficient.
  - Updated [breadcrumb trail tag] to allow the specification of a start and an end level and added
    better node change checking.

* Bug fixes:

  - Meta information `sort_info` was not correctly set which lead to sort errors when creating menus.
  - Fixed bug with meta information change detection: `modified_at` was taken into account although
    this changes on every content change.
  - Fix some other bugs releated to the meta information `modified_at`.
  - An API change in facets from version 2.4.1 to 2.4.3 prevented webgen from working, now facets
    2.4.3 is needed for webgen.
