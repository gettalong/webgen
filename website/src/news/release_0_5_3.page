### Changes

This release brings some usability and feature enhancements to webgen as well as several bug
fixes. Also note that this release requires facets version 2.4.3 instead of 2.4.1!

* Setting some configuration options (for example, the path patterns used by
  Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy) was very complicated in previous releases. With the introduction of
  configuration file helpers this gets much easier now. For example, adding some path patterns for
  Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy can be done like this now:

      patterns:
        Copy:
          add: [**/*.pdf, **/*.avi]

* A new source handler for automatic feed generation has been added. This is the first part of the
  blogging support that will be introduced in the following versions of webgen.

* The styling of the menu tag has been modified: an additional CSS class specifying the current menu
  level has been added and the surrounding `div` tag has been removed.

  > **Attention**: This may break websites which relied on the surrounding `div` tag with the
  > `webgen-menu` CSS class for styling.

* I have added [upgrading]({relocatable: ../documentation/upgrading.html}) information for upgrading
  0.4.x websites to 0.5.x.

* Major enhancements:

  - Added a [feed source handler] for generating atom and/or RSS feeds.
  - Added a [sitemap source handler] for generating XML sitemaps
  - Ported the [sitemap tag] and feature-enhanced it

* Minor enhancements:

  - Added configuration file helpers, see [configuration file] documentation.
  - Updated [metainfo source handler] to be more efficient.
  - Updated [breadcrumb trail tag] to allow the specification of a start and an end level and added
    better node change checking.
  - Added new meta information `kind` for specifying the kind of a node (used, for example, by the
    new sitemap tag)
  - Added new meta information `change_freq` and `priority` (used by the new sitemap source handler)
  - Added new meta information `draft` which can be set on paths that should not create any nodes
  - New level specific CSS class names for generated menus
  - Removed unnecessary `div` tag surrounding generated menus
  - Added upgrading information

* Bug fixes:

  - Meta information `sort_info` was not correctly set which lead to sort errors when creating menus.
  - Fixed bug with meta information change detection: `modified_at` was taken into account although
    this changes on every content change.
  - Fix some other bugs releated to the meta information `modified_at`.
  - An API change in facets from version 2.4.1 to 2.4.3 prevented webgen from working, now facets
    2.4.3 is needed for webgen.
  - Fixed bug in template source handler: template chain resolution stopped at default.template in
    sub directory and did not go further towards the root directory.
