### Changes

The main emphasis on this release lies on a new implementation of the update tree/write tree cycle
which now also allows the creation of nodes not only in the update tree phase but also in the write
phase. A user visible change of this is, for example, that nodes for page fragment are now not
created at page node creation time but through a content processor when the page node is
written. Since menus would not be correctly generated in this situation, the update/write cycle is
now executed as often as needed (which amounts to two times in nearly all situations).

> Since the internal code changed a lot from the last release, you may need to update your
> extensions to comply with the new internal API! Have a look at the ChangeLog or the `git log` to
> see all changes.

Building on the above changes a new webgen tag for generating high quality graphics using the LaTeX
library PGF/TikZ is now available.

The next release of webgen will concentrate on the blog support. For example, a source handler for
automatically generating tag pages is in the works. Stay tuned!
