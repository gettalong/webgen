### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

--- name:notes pipeline:tags,kramdown

This is just a small release which fixes a bug with absolute virtual URLs. The only change feature
wise was the addition of the configuration option `tag.menu.nested` which allows to generate either
a nested or a sequential menu (like the horizontal menu style in webgen 0.4.x).

If you want to live on the edge, a beta gem is now provided via Github's gem server. To use the beta
gem you need to run

    gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    gem install gettalong-webgen

Be aware that these beta gems are not officially supported but are normally in quite a useable state
and are updated more often than the official gem for testing purposes.
