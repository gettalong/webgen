### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

--- name:notes pipeline:tags,kramdown

This release includes two minor changes and some bug fixes: The output of the [meta information
tag][1] is now escaped by default. This can be changed by setting the `tag.metainfo.escape_html`
option in the configuration file. And a rake task for showing outdated translations has been added.
