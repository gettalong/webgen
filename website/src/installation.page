## Download & Installation

There are currently two versions of webgen:

* The 0.5.x series: This is the new *stable* series. A completely new implementation of the core
  allows for advanced features like partial site regeneration. It provides many features out of the
  box (though currently a bit less than the old 0.4.x series) and is very user friendly.

* The 0.4.x series: This is the old stable series which can still be used but is not updated
  anymore. The complete documentation (including installation information and needed libraries) for
  the last version of the 0.4.x series can be found [here](documentation/0.4.x/index.html).

The installation notes below focus on the 0.5.x series since the 0.4.x series is not actively
developed anymore.


## Compatibility Notes

webgen should run on any platform which supports Ruby. It has been successfully tested on the
following platforms:

* Linux with Ruby 1.8.6
* Mac OSX with Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.8.7
* Windows XP with latest Ruby 1.8.6 from One-Click-Installer

See the platform specific installation notes for more information!

Furthermore, webgen should also run on jruby 1.1.3 and ruby 1.9.1 but that has not been extensively
tested.

> Ruby 1.9.1 support notes (as of 2009-02-13):
>
> * All unit tests run fine except those which use libraries that have not been fixed to work with
>   1.9.1 yet (ie. feedtools).
>
> * The webgen webgui won't work because one of its dependencies, rack 0.9.1, is not 1.9.1
>   compatible.
>
> * There may be problems with Maruku and character encodings.

## Platform Specific Installation Instructions

### Linux

There are a variety of Linux distributions out there with different package management systems. So I
will focus on instructions for Ubuntu 8.10 here (which should also work for any recent Debian based
distribution).

After running the following commands, webgen and all the mandatory dependencies are installed:

    sudo aptitude install ruby rubygems
    sudo gem1.8 install webgen

> Ubuntu has a package for the old 0.4.7 version of webgen. If you want to use that, you just need
> to run
>
>     sudo aptitude install webgen0.4
{.information}

### Mac OS X

Mac OS Leopard comes with Ruby and Rubygems preinstalled. However, the Rubygems version is rather
old and needs to be updated. This can be done by running the following commands:

    sudo gem install rubygems-update
    sudo update_rubygems

After that your system is ready for installing webgen:

    sudo gem install webgen

### Windows

You need to install Ruby first. This can easily be done by using the One-Click-Installer - just
download the *latest* installation binary from the [files section][1] of the One-Click-Installer
homepage and run it. After that open a command shell (select `Start -> Run...`, then enter `cmd` and
click on `Ok`) and type in the following:

    gem install webgen

## Generic Installation Instructions

### Using Rubygems

If you are using Rubygems, installing the latest version of webgen is as simple as executing

    gem install webgen

or, if you want to install the latest version of the old series, just use

    gem install webgen -v '< 0.5.0'

After this command has finished, everything is ready for creating websites. Be sure to have a look
at the optional dependencies which provide additional functionality.

> Rubygems 1.2.0 has a bug that prevents the correct resolution of development dependencies.
> Therefore you should upgrade to at least 1.3.0 which fixes this bug. Otherwise you will
> have to use the following command to install webgen:
>
>     gem install --development webgen
{.error}


### Manual Installation

The latest version of webgen can always be downloaded from [webgen's files section on
Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=296). After the download the package needs to be
decompressed and then you can install webgen using the included `setup.rb` installation method:

    $ ruby setup.rb config
    $ ruby setup.rb setup
    $ ruby setup.rb install

Make sure that you also install the mandatory and, if you need them, the optional dependencies.


### Using the repository version

webgen uses git as its versioning system and webgen's repository is hosted primarily on Rubyforge
but I have also created a clone of it on GitHub. The repositories always contains a clean state of
the current development version of webgen, i.e. webgen should always work when checked out from the
repository. To check out webgen use one of the following commands:

     git clone git://rubyforge.org/webgen.git
     git clone git://github.com/gettalong/webgen.git


## Dependencies

The following list shows all mandatory and optional dependencies for webgen. If you use Rubygems,
the mandatory dependencies are automatically installed. webgen can make use of the optional
dependencies if they are installed. Note that webgen was tested against the specified versions but
it should normally work with newer versions, too!

* (mandatory) [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) version 1.8.6 or 1.8.7. Since webgen is written in
  Ruby, you need the Ruby interpreter to run webgen.

* (mandatory) [cmdparse](http://cmdparse.rubyforge.org) version 2.0.2 or higher

* (mandatory) [facets](http://facets.rubyforge.org) version 2.4.5

* (mandatory) [maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org) version 0.5.9

* (mandatory for webgui) [ramaze](http://ramaze.net) version 2009.02

* (optional for webgui) [launchy](http://copiousfreetime.rubyforge.org/launchy/) version 0.3.2

* (optional) [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org) version 0.8.3 or higher for using the created
  website Rakefiles

* (optional) [RedCloth](http://redcloth.rubyforge.org) version 3.0.0 or higher for Textile support

* (optional) [haml](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com) version 2.0.9 or higher for haml and sass support

* (optional) [builder](http://builder.rubyforge.org) version 2.1.0 or higher for programmatic xml
  generation support

* (optional) [rdoc](http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/) version 2.4.2 or higher for RDoc markup support

* (optional) [coderay](http://coderay.rubychan.de/) version 0.7.4.214 or higher for syntax
  highlighting

* (optional) [feedtools](http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools) version 0.2.29 or higher for
  built-in feed generation support

* (optional) [erubis](http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/) version 2.6.2 or higher for Erubis
  (enhanced ERB) support

  Markdown support

* (optional) [archive-tar-minitar](http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruwiki/) version 0.5.2 or higher
  for (gzipped) tar archives as sources

All these libraries can be installed via Rubygems (which I recommend).
